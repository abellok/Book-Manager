# Book Collection Manager
## Personal Project Proposal

My proposed project is a *book collection manager* application which
will be able to catalogue inputted books, in addition to their information
(such as genre, author, page length, etc.)

Possible audiences who may use this application include:
- Bookstores
- Libraries
- Individual book collectors

This project interests me, because I myself am a book collector. I believe that
such an application will provide greater organization and convenience
for individuals who may need to navigate a large collection
of books, in both professional and personal settings.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add books (and their information) to the collection
- As a user, I want to be able to delete books from the collection
- As a user, I want to view all the titles or authors in the collection
- As a user, I want to save my book collection to a file
- As a user, when I start the application I want to be able to open a saved book collection

**Other possible user stories not currently implemented:**
- As a user, I want to be able to rate books on a scale of 1-5 stars
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a certain book based on title, author, genre, or page length
- As a user, I want to see statistical facts about my book collection (# of books, # of authors, total # of pages, etc.)

## Phase 4: Task 2

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on my project, I would definitely refactor to improve my design. 
Currently, all my UI code for the graphic interface is in a single class... this makes the readability of my code 
low, as it is not organized or separated in any way. Thus, I would probably split the different buttons and their 
associated actions into their own classes, and have the GUI class call methods in each of those separated classes.
