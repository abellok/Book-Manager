# Book Collection Manager
## Personal Project Proposal

My proposed project is a **book collection manager** application which
will be able to catalogue inputted books, in addition to their information
(such as genre, author, page length, etc.)

Possible audiences who may use this application include:
- Bookstores
- Libraries
- Individual book collectors

This project interests me, because I myself am a book collector. I believe that
such an application will provide greater organization and convenience
for individuals who may need to navigate a large collection
of books, in both professional and personal settings.
