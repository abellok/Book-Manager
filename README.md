# Book Collection Manager
## Personal Project Proposal

My proposed project is a *book collection manager* application which
will be able to catalogue inputted books, in addition to their information
(such as genre, author, page length, etc.)

Possible audiences who may use this application include:
- Bookstores
- Libraries
- Individual book collectors

This project interests me, because I myself am a book collector. I believe that
such an application will provide greater organization and convenience
for individuals who may need to navigate a large collection
of books, in both professional and personal settings.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add books (and their information) to the collection
- As a user, I want to be able to delete books from the collection
- As a user, I want to view all the titles or authors in the collection
- As a user, I want to save my book collection to a file
- As a user, when I start the application I want to be able to open a saved book collection

**Other possible user stories not currently implemented:**
- As a user, I want to be able to rate books on a scale of 1-5 stars
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a certain book based on title, author, genre, or page length
- As a user, I want to see statistical facts about my book collection (# of books, # of authors, total # of pages, etc.)
